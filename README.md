# Live Wallpaper - Dragons

**Live Wallpaper - Dragons** is a project aimed at creating an interactive and dynamic wallpaper, where dragons follow the movement of the cursor, bringing life to your desktop background. This project is an opportunity to explore graphical development and animations using C++ and the **SFML** (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

## Goals

- Develop an **animated wallpaper** in C++ that functions as an interactive desktop background.
- Utilize the **SFML** library to handle graphics, textures, and mouse movement capture, creating a fluid and visually engaging experience.
- Implement animated dragons that **follow the cursor's movement** across the screen, with visual effects such as shadows and ripples to simulate depth and fluidity.
- Learn and apply **code management practices** using Git and GitHub Projects, following the GitFlow workflow for organized and efficient version control.

## Key Features

- **Interactive animation**: Dragons react and follow the cursor in real-time.
- **Visual effects**: Simulate fluid movement, dynamic shadows, and animation of dragon parts such as the tail and fins.
- **Optimized performance**: Ensure that the wallpaper remains lightweight and efficient, even with multiple dragons on the screen.

## Technologies Used

- **C++**: The main language for project development, focusing on performance control and code organization.
- **SFML**: A library for handling graphics, events, and animations.
- **GitHub Projects**: For task organization and tracking the project's progress.
- **GitFlow**: A version control methodology to keep the development organized, with separate branches for new features and bug fixes.
